    # Introduction

    OneOffice provides REST APIs to enable access to perform Life Policy
    Administration functions which includes but not limited to Create, Update
    and Retrieve Customers, Create and Maintain Policies, Manage Benefits,
    Retrieve Transactions & Diary Events, Handling Payments, Handling Periodic
    Debits and Claims Management.  


    The APIs are having a predictable resource URLs and APIs expect and produce
    JSON payloads to perform all these mentioned operations.  You can use your
    favorite HTTP/REST library for your programming language to use OneOffice
    APIs.


    # Authentication

    OneOffice APIs  offers following authentication mechanism 
      - **OAuth 2.0** - OneOffice APIs would follow the OAuth2.0 with the client credentials flow. A client_id and client_secret will be issued to the consumer of APIs in order to obtain access token. This token will then be included in request header as a bearer token for subsequest API requests. The generated tokens will have an expiry period (in minutes) after which a fresh token will be needed by caller of API.   


    # Getting Started

    Once a valid account is registered by OneOffice support staff the corresponding details will be shared to consumers. This will contain a client_id and client_secret to obtain an access toekn. Consumer application will have to access the **/Auth/Token**
    endpoint for posting the provided credentials. 

    After validating the accuracy of the provided client_id/client_secret, API will
    generate an access token (Bearer token) which will be passed in subsequent API's request headers.     

    Please refer to **/Auth/Token** request/response model examples for more
    details on how to obtain an access token. 

    ```Note
      OneOffice APIs use HTTPS protocol to secure the communication between client and API services.

      summary: To Initiate a Payment Request
      description: >
        This endpoint is used to initialize a payment requrest against a policy available in OneOffice. System will firstly verifiy the policy number and status before processing this request. Policies with 'Enforce' and 'Pending-Lapsed' status will accept these adhoc payments. Upon successful validation, system will add balance amount in policy segment balance and will execute charges function to generate insurance transactions. This would yeild an updated paid to date along with a revised next debit date (if applicable).        
        API accepts a body object which includes policy number, paid amount and a preferred charges run date. 
        
        The response of this API is segment balance and next debit date
